# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the Web Matters [code of conduct](http://www.web-matters.co.uk/code-of-conduct.html).

## Process

The site is served by GitHub Pages from `master` so do not directly commit to `master`.

We operate a two-phase commit policy, so all code should be reviewed before being merged.

Make your changes in a branch or a fork and open a pull request against `master`.  Once this has been reviewed and approved it can be merged into `master`.

## Big changes

Please discuss big changes - like changing everything over to `$your_favourite_tool_chain` - in a issue first.  We don't want you to do a lot of work only to find that it's not something we can accept.
